## Bone Marrow Organ Donation for Liver Cirrhosis
This is a NetBeans project aimed at facilitating the process of bone marrow organ donation for patients suffering from liver cirrhosis. The project provides a platform for potential donors to register themselves, undergo medical evaluation, and match with registered patients in need of bone marrow transplants.

# Features
1. Donor Registration: Donors can create an account by providing their personal information such as name, contact details, age, and medical history.
2. Medical Evaluation: Registered donors are required to undergo a comprehensive medical evaluation to determine their suitability for bone marrow donation. The evaluation process involves medical tests and consultations with healthcare professionals.
3. Patient Registration: Patients with liver cirrhosis can create an account and provide their relevant details such as name, age, contact information, and medical history.
4. Matchmaking: The system matches registered patients with compatible donors based on various factors such as tissue type, blood group, and medical compatibility. If a match is found, both the patient and the donor are notified.
5. Notification System: The system sends notifications to donors and patients regarding their registration status, evaluation appointments, and potential matches.
6. Admin Panel: An administrator panel is provided to manage user registrations, evaluate donor information, and monitor the matching process.
